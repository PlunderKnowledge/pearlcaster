Disseminate Ideas to where they can do the most good.

  You've got great ideas...   lots of 'em...  so many in fact that there's no
way you'll ever get beyond the daydreaming stage with most of them.  This is
a tragedy.  So what do you do with these pearls?   Cast them before the rest of
us swine!
